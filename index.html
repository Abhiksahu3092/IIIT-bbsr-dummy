        <h1>About the institute</h1>
        <p>IIIT Bhubaneswar owes its origins to the initiative of the Government Odisha. It is a result of the desire of the Government to establish a world class institute of Information Technology in the state. The Institute has been registered as a society in Nov 2006. In January 2014, the Institute is converted to a University by the Government of Odisha.

            There is misconception that IIIT Bhubaneswar is a Institute promoted in PPP mode by the Government. The Institute is fully owned by the Government of Odisha. The Information Technology Department is the controlling Department. The Government provides funds for the Infrastructure creation. However, the Institute has to earn its Revenue Expenditure. This is the model in all State Government promoted IIITs in Bangalore, Hyderabad and Delhi. The Institute enjoys academic, financial and administrative autonomy by the powers invested through the IIIT Bhubaneswar act. IIIT aspires to be a national Institute in line with its Peer Institutes.
            
            The Governance structure of the Institute is modelled after those of the IITs. The Governor of the state is the Chancellor of the Institute. The Board of Governors has members from Odisha Legislative Assembly, Government of Odisha, Leaders from the IT industry and Eminent educationists. Currently, the Chairman of the Institute is the Chief Secretary of the Government of Odisha. The Director is the Executive Head of the Institute. The Director is assisted by the Registrar, the Deans, the Controller of examinations and the Comptroller of finance in day-to-day management of the Institute
            
            The Institute has its focus on quality and rigorous education, quality resource, academic infrastructure, technology and innovation. These initiatives have helped IIIT-Bhubaneswar achieve pre-eminence in India and beyond.</p>

        <p>The campus is located in Gothapatna, Bhubaneswar, and is spread over 23 acres of land. It houses classrooms, laboratories, a library, hostel, faculty living quarters, sports facilities, and an auditorium.IIIT Bhubaneswar was initiated by the Government of Odisha and registered as a society in 2006,[1] with the goal of providing quality technical education in the field of Information Technology. The institute started operating in September 2007[1] with the first batch of undergraduate students.

            The institute owes its origins to the private initiative of the Government of Odisha, which recognized the need for a technical university that could provide quality education in the field of Information Technology. In 2005, the then President of India, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, laid the foundation stone for the institute.
            
            The management of the institute is in the hands of a governing body, consisting of representatives from the government of Odisha, leaders from the IT industry, and educationists. The institute is also recognized as a University Grants Commission (India) (UGC) recognised Unitary Technical University.</p>
